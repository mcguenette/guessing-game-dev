# guessing-game-dev

A game where a player has 5 attempts to guess the secret number.
The number is between 1-50 & there are messages to show how close you are.
Guess away!

Directions from project:
• Start a new project from scratch.
• Use part of the existing code in your new code.
• Improve your programming logic, if necessary.
• Make your page look like a game, not a regular web page.
• Add a ‘restart’ button, which will only be shown when the game is over.
